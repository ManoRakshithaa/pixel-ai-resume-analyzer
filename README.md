## 📖 Overview
Pixel AI Resume Analyzer is a lightweight web app that helps candidates quickly check their resumes against job descriptions.  

It provides:
- ✅ **Resume text extraction** (paste your resume text into the input box)  
- ✅ **Heuristic Analysis** (sections, skills, formatting checks)  
- ✅ **Job Match Score** (0–100%) based on keyword matching  
- ✅ **Professional Dashboard UI** with progress indicators and analysis cards  
- ✅ **Export Results** to share or save  

⚠️ Note: At this stage, uploading a PDF doesn’t parse automatically — users can paste their resume text into the text box for analysis.
